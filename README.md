### Milestone Progress

**Milestone 1**: 
This week I worked on setting up my project. I forked my project from the [Gatsby Ghost Starter](https://github.com/TryGhost/gatsby-starter-ghost) repo, and then I deployed it using Netlify and Heroku.
The technologies I'm utilizing this month are:
> React
> Handlebars
> Tailwind CSS
> Gatsby
> Ghost
> Netlify
> Heroku


**Milestone 2**:    
This week, I installed and researched Tailwind CSS with my project. I'm working on creating a custom theme.
...

**Milestone 3**:    
This week I focused on getting the backend to work. I worked on the functionality of the Projects and Blogs pages.

**Milestone 4**:   
This week I finalized my website design. I ended up using vanilla CSS rather than Tailwind. Some of the functionality is still buggy, but for the most part, the website is up and running. Also, I decided against making a custom domain so that I wouldn't complicate things in the final week.
