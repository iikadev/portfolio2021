### Milestone Progress

**Milestone 1**: 
This week I worked on setting up my project. I forked my project from the [Gatsby Ghost Starter](https://github.com/TryGhost/gatsby-starter-ghost) repo, and then I deployed it using Netlify and Heroku.
The technologies I'm utilizing this month are:
> React
> Handlebars
> Tailwind CSS
> Gatsby
> Ghost
> Netlify
> Heroku


**Milestone 2**:    
This week, I installed and researched Tailwind CSS with my project. I'm working on creating a custom theme.
