# Project Issues
--

[x] Where is the *Skills Page* component to edit... ??

[x] Both *Project tags* and *Blog tags* are loading on the *Blog Page*-- but, nothing loads on the *Project Page*.
    Something must be wrong with the '// Create post pages' function in gatsby-node.js

[x] There is a *default footer* from Ghost. I don't want it to show on the home
   page, but I want it to show the other pages.

[x] How do the *social media links* work? I need to change them to LinkedIn and GitHub.

[x] The *page links* on the home page lead to *404* (ex. the 'about me' link on the hero image)

[x] *Contact Page* link leads to a runtime error:
	Attempted import error: 'ContactPage' is not exported 
	from '../components/common/ContactPage' (imported as 'ContactPage').

[x] *Contact form* doesn't do anything. Does it link up with the backend? Or..?

[x] How do I set up the *pagination* on the *Blog Page*? There is a 'pagination' component in the Gatsby project..?

# Things to do still

[] Once pages are loading in correctly, finish the styling

[] Add resume to 'download resume' link (open new tab)

[] Add function 'back to top' scroll button

[] Add media queries so that it is responsive

[] Add keywords to metatags

[] Replace dummy data with real data

[] Find different font for website

[] Find plugin or something to add animated particle effect to home page

[] Fix the pagination link breaking issue on blog/project pages

[] Change domain name (?)
